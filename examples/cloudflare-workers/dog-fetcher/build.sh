# Compile worker.lisp to the .wasm module the Worker imports.
#
# --no-wasi: the Worker calls the exported entry point directly, so the module
#   needs no WASI imports -- it becomes a reactor (`_initialize`, not `_start`).
#   Its ONE import is env.fetch, declared by worker.lisp's rontolisp:wasm-import.
# --optimize=size: a Worker bundle has a size limit; tiny-routes/lite is what
#   keeps cl-ppcre out of what the tree-shaker has to keep.
#
# The first run downloads clack/lack/tiny-routes into ~/.rontolisp/quicklisp;
# after that the build is offline.
